                <div id="minecraftDetail">
                    <p class="detail">Much to his credit, Jack actually does rather well at hardcore Minecraft. He's only gone and died so many times that the exact figure cannot be remembered. He is good at building to be fair. His worlds often take a medieval/gothic theme, with sometimes a splash of viking in there. His building style often results in every world looking the same, but that doesnt matter as with his choice of resource and shader packs. It's rather bloody beautiful.</p>

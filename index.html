                        <p>Pyroscythe, aka Pyro, aka Jack is a small time streamer out of Melbourne, Australia.</p>
                        <p>His streams often include hardcore minecraft with a lot of profanity, maybe even a bit too much.</p>

                        <h2 id="sectionTitle">Variety:</h2>
                        <p>After a small taste of success, Jack decided to branch out to try help grow his fan base, I mean community.</p>
                        <p>It was also at this time that Jack tried to branch out to something other than just minecraft content. He failed miserably and is back to minecraft indefinitely.</p>

                        <p>Jack one day decided that TikTok may be a good place to go.</p>
                        <p>He started off humbly, posting minecraft tips and tricks. Rating other content creators skins.</p>
                        <p>No one is still really sure as to whether or not selling his soul to the chinese paid off or not.</p>

                <div id="minecraftDetail">
                    <p>Much to his credit, Jack actually does rather well at hardcore Minecraft. He's only gone and died so many times that the exact figure cannot be remembered. He is good at building to be fair. His worlds often take a medieval/gothic theme, with sometimes a splash of viking in there. His building style often results in every world looking the same, but that doesnt matter as with his choice of resource and shader packs. It's rather bloody beautiful.</p>
